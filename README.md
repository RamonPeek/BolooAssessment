# BolooAssessment

I spent about 30 minutes researching the basics of React and FastAPI before starting this assessment.
Start time: 12:43 (10/07/2024).

Considerations:
- This is my first React project and FastAPI project, so part of the time was spent researching how to set up certain parts of the code or debugging why things did not work as expected.
- I used 30 minutes before starting the assignemnt to do pre research on React and FastAPI, additionally I did some research within my 1 hour time window.
- I did not put any effort in creating a nice looking UI or setting up a frontend framework.
- I tried to fiddle around as much as possible with FastAPI, including returning more than only OK responses, and doing some validations.
- There is some boiler plate code from the default React project outside of the scope of the assignment, you can ignore those files (things such as css files).
